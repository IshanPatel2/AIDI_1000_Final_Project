# Project Goal:
Text feature extraction and pre-processing for classification algorithms are very significant. In this section, we start to talk about text cleaning since most of documents contain a lot of noise. In this part, we discuss two primary methods of text feature extractions- word embedding and weighted word.
1)Text Cleaning and Pre-processing
2)Tokenization
3)Stop words
4)Capitalization

# Steps to run our code:
1) Import the dataset from the above link.
2) Load the datasets and try to perform different algorithms.

# Tools, Software and Libraries

  1. Jupyter Notebook

  2. Numpy

  3. Pandas

  4. Seaborn

  5. Matplotlib

  6. Scikit-learn
  
  7. Transformers
  
  8. Torch

  9. sklearn.metrics
      
  10. Glove

We implemented all the algorithms and also added our own algorithm to compare the accuracy and to find out which algorithms works best for the text classification on chosen dataset.
